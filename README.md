# Justin Hamerly-Spain

My name is Justin and I started my software development journey in 2020 when reevaluating my learning goals and priorities during the pandemic.  Previously, I was working in architecture by designing custom homes.  What I have learned through my time coding and in my previous career is that I have a passion for creating new solutions focused on solving problems for people.  Technology can be used to enhance and enrich the human experience, and my mission is to contribute to this cause.

My Core Strengths:

- being detail-oriented
- breaking down abstractions
- solving complex problems creatively and with an open-mind
- fully embracing collaboration

My Values:

- working on diverse teams
- creating inclusive solutions
- fostering new and sometimes unconventional solutions
- focusing on people first

When not working, I am a board gamer, kayaker and a lover of all animals.  I have a feisty cat named Vladimir, and a lizard with a blue-tonuge named Ghost.  I am a Seattle native, and a lover of the Pacific Northwest (but, ironically, you will never catch me camping or hiking).

Thank you for visiting my Repository, and I look forward to meeting you!
